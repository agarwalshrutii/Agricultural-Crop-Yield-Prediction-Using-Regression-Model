# Agricultural-Crop-Yield-Prediction-Using-Regression-Model

Description:

The agricultural crop yield prediction project is based on regression modeling, leveraging features such as annual rainfall, pesticide usage, etc. By analyzing historical crop yield data alongside these relevant agricultural attributes, the project aims to develop accurate regression models that can forecast crop yields for future seasons.
